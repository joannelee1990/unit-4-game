# unit-4-game: Potato Game

### Details on the assignment
This is the creation of a game called Potato Game. This app is useful because it shows how jQuery code can be used alongside Javascript to dynamically update HTML and CSS.

### Details on the game
You will be given a random number at the start of the game in the "Random Number" box. There are four different images on ways to eat potatoes below. By clicking 
on one of the potato images, you will add a specifc amount of points to 
the "Your Total Score is:" section. For each round the amounts assigned to
the images will not change however once you start a new round, a new number 
wilL be assigned to each image. You win the game by matching your total score to the random number. You lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

### Why make this game?
This project is useful because it shows how a simple HTML can be changed by jQuery & Javascript to make a dynamic game.

### How you create the game
The creation of this game starts out with pseudo-coding all of the steps in detail. Then comes the assigning of variables, creating functions and if/else statements. After you've checked that the game is working through console.log you can go in and edit the HTML elements to make the webpage become a functioning dynamic game.  

There were many examples of similar projects found on Github, Stack Overflow, and W3 Schools which you could use as reference. However just googling certain parts that you are stuck on help as well. (*Google Fu!*) Also, turning to your classmates helps a great deal. I learned that just by talking it out with classmates, often times you are able to answer your questions yourself! 

Good luck! HAPPY EATING!
